==== Design Challenges ====

Right now, we're seeding the restaurant ratings with those from Yelp and Google Places. Terms of usage might limit this functionality, so we might want to think about taking this out. In the limit (10k+ users / city), we won't need any data from Google or Yelp


Current plan is to have several  different kinds of tables (in addition to the user table which should be self explanatory)

"Characteristics Table". This is kind of like the "what type of movie do you like watching" from Netflix. It allows our system to be seeded with some initial data. If there were only 1 person using our service, the results from searches would come from what type of characteristics they like. If you like wine-bars, our search feature would return all the wine-bars in a certain area. 
	- Characteristic Name (e.g. Bistro Lunches, Movie-goer)
	- Category (e.g. Food, Theater)
	- ...
	

"Business Table". This table contains info about activites in the area. Key elements include:
	- Name
	- Category (only one per business, let's say. Examples include restaurant, museum, park, theater?
	- Keywords?? (should be an array of elements. Might be easier to just dedicate 10 columns of MySql to all possible keywords
	- Description
	- Pricing This will be hard to figure out, because we're going to have to maintain this as a searchable parameter
	- Hours of Operation?
	- Average Rating

	+ Activity Table? Maybe keep a separate table for things like "activities" such as seeing a movie, going for a walk???? Version 2 stuff?

"Outing Table". Take the business / activity table, but now add a dimension of distance / time to it. An outing will consist of a sequence of businesses and activities, and will have an entirely separate rating system. This table will contain:
	- Outing Name
	- Outing Keywords (again same issue as business table)
	- Description
	- Pricing
	- Average Rating
	
	


Int addition to the tables, there has to be matrices describing their relation:

User-Characteristic Matrix: NROWS=Users, NCOLS=characteristics:   binary system for characteristics the user cares about)
Business-Characteristic Matrix: NROWS=Users, NCOLS=characteristics:   binary system for characteristics classifying a business. Might not be possible... (essentially, match keywords to businesss)

Business Matrix: NROWS=users, NCOLS=Businesses:  3-4 star system for businesses the user cares about (one star dedicated for "omitted")

Outing Matrix: NROWS=users, NCOLS=Outings: 3-4 star system for rating outings (one star dedicated for "omitted")
