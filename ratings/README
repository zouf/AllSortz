Joey + Matt Discussion

- For recommendations: don't just take the rating of the most similar person. 
- We can use the Peasron correlation to determine "how similar" (positive corr.) and "how disimilar" (negative corr.) users are. We can look at users with 0.75-1.0 positive correlation (let's say) and -.9 to -1.0 negative correlation. We take a weighted average between these (naturally flipping the negativity of the negative correlation). Figuring out the thresholds will be a big part of the model.
- This is going to require  a ton of computation, so we're going to have a permanent background task running (maybe it runs every 5 minutes on a copy of the table). 
- We should figure out how to really optimize the Python to do this quickly (cough cough, parallelizing python code, cough cough :) )
