- In tasks.py:
	+ calculate_recommendation needs to be implemented
	+ Given a matrix of related users, calculate a new rating for a business
	+ A big part is going to be cutting off users that don't have sufficient positive or negative correlation
	
- Webcrawler:
	- Need to crawl Yelp and Google in a separate 

- Add reviews

- Searching in MySql
	+ figure out a way to use keywords
	
	
-Create a way to test functionality	
	+ Presumably, Deep will not be done with the web crawler for a little bit, so we should come up with a way to actually

	+ We're going to have to think about common food-rating situations you might come across.
		for example, a new place opens and you don't want it to get lost in the realm of older more established places
		Location-based problems. For example, users from SF and NY aren't going to have a lot of overlap
		
+ Add support for "Trending" restaraunts (those that have gotten dozens of reviews recently)
