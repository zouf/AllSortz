-Joey and Matt meet to work on calculate_rec
- Figure out git issues
- Made some progress, there is a triply nested loop:
	users, correlated users, then all businesses then calc rating
- Right now, it just takes the average of all those users who are sufficiently correlated. 
- if the average of likes > dislikes, then select it. This rating system seems a little primitive, maybe rethink
-There's also a bug in tasks.py caused by the fact we're using conflicting rating systems.
	+ Establish a concrete mapping (e.g.  like-> 1, hate ->-1, meh ->0)
