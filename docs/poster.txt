Below are the ideas we have for the individual pages for the poster
session. Each block starts off with the sort of theme for that group,
then each - represents a page.

Problem and Algorithm
- description of the problem
- description of NMF and SVD
- Talk about alpha, beta, k values (related to results)
- Talk RBM and that we might implement (but we won't)

Data/Challenges/Ongoing issues
- Yelp data set, some users/business have 1 rating (etc)
- Have been training and working with Michigan data, plan to test on Princeton
- Speed: talk about moving to C++ from python and the speedup?

Results
- graph of RSS vs varying k value
- graph of run times for alpha/beta values
- graph/table of the latent variables and the tags it finds
- Show comparison to simple P correlation?
