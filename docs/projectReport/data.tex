We acquired the academic dataset from Yelp. The rating consists of \numUserTotal
users and \numBusTotal businesses. The businesses are all located in the vicinity of $30$ different
universities in the United States. There are a total of \numRatingTotal ratings. We initially
misunderstood the datasets. We thought we were obtaining two different
datasets, one from Michigan and one from Princeton, but we actually received the
entire dataset twice. Our initial plan was to get two different datasets,
training on the first then finally testing on the second. Unfortunately we
unknowingly trained on the entire body of data, so we weren't able to test on
any fresh data. 

For our application, this isn't as big of a problem as others in practice. This
is because in practice, we will be able to tune the model on the entire body of
data fairly often. Because of our optimizations, tests run fairly quickly making
it possible to adjust the model fairly often. Keeping a set of fresh data to
test on is important for situations where you wish to have a solution that will
work on all datasets without any need for tuning and that really isn't our goal.
