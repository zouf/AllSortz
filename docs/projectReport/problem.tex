``What should I do when I'm bored?''  is a question that almost everyone has
asked at one time. A brief look at common Google searches highlights the demand
for activity ideas. We started this project to be able to answer this question
for our users. The only information that should be required from a user is 
a number of ratings of other businesses. Using only that information we want to
be able to give a predicted rating for any other business. We should also be
able to give a user a list of their highest predicted ratings as a good answer
to ``what should I do?''. Additionally we would like to give a user some insight
into why we are recommending a business. This will help to give confidence in
our recommendations, and will also give the user some expectation of what to
expect when they arrive at the business.
